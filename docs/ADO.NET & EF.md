## ADO.NET

### What are the main components of ADO.NET?

ADO.NET is a data access technology in .NET framework that provides a set of components and classes to interact with databases. The main components of ADO.NET are:

1. **Connection**: The Connection object establishes a connection to the database. It manages the connection state, authentication, and communication with the database server.

2. **Command**: The Command object represents an SQL statement or a stored procedure that is executed against the database. It provides methods to execute queries, retrieve data, and perform database operations.

3. **DataReader**: The DataReader object provides a fast, forward-only, read-only stream of data from the database. It is used to efficiently retrieve and read data from a query result set.

4. **DataAdapter**: The DataAdapter object acts as a bridge between the DataSet and the database. It fills the DataSet with data from the database and updates the database with changes made to the DataSet.

5. **DataSet**: The DataSet object is an in-memory representation of data retrieved from the database. It can hold multiple tables, relationships, and constraints. It provides a disconnected and cacheable view of data.

6. **DataTable**: The DataTable object represents a single table of data within a DataSet. It consists of a collection of rows and columns, and it supports operations like filtering, sorting, and data manipulation.

7. **DataView**: The DataView object provides a customized view of a DataTable. It allows filtering, sorting, and searching within the DataTable and provides a different presentation of the data.

8. **Parameter**: The Parameter object is used to pass values to the Command object's parameters. It ensures the proper handling and formatting of data while interacting with the database.

These components work together to facilitate data access and manipulation in ADO.NET applications. They provide a flexible and efficient way to interact with databases using .NET framework.

### What is Connected architecture and Disconnected architecture?

Connected architecture and Disconnected architecture are two different approaches for interacting with databases in ADO.NET.

**Connected architecture**: In connected architecture, a direct and continuous connection is established between the application and the database server. The connection remains open throughout the duration of the database operation, such as querying or updating data. The main components used in connected architecture are Connection and Command.

Advantages of connected architecture:
- Allows real-time access to the database.
- Suitable for scenarios where immediate data consistency is required.
- Supports transactions and provides better control over database operations.

Disadvantages of connected architecture:
- Requires a continuous connection to the database, which may lead to resource consumption.
- Limited scalability due to the need for multiple simultaneous connections.
- Performance may be impacted if the network latency is high.

**Disconnected architecture**: In disconnected architecture, the connection to the database is only opened when data needs to be fetched or updated. Once the data is retrieved, the connection is closed, and the data is held in memory. The main components used in disconnected architecture are DataAdapter, DataSet, DataTable, and DataView.

Advantages of disconnected architecture:
- Reduces the overhead of maintaining continuous database connections.
- Improves scalability as multiple operations can be performed offline without holding a connection.
- Supports offline data manipulation and synchronization.

Disadvantages of disconnected architecture:
- May not provide real-time access to the database as data is fetched and updated in batches.
- Requires additional memory to hold the data in memory.
- Data may become stale if updates are made in the database by other applications.

Disconnected architecture is commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be fetched or updated in batches, and real-time access is not critical. It provides flexibility, scalability, and the ability to work offline with data.

### What are the different Execute Methods of ADO.NET?

ADO.NET provides several Execute methods that are used to execute SQL commands and retrieve the results from a database. Here are the commonly used Execute methods in ADO.NET:

1. **ExecuteNonQuery**:
   - Executes a SQL command that doesn't return any result set, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements.
   - Returns the number of rows affected by the command.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
     {
         connection.Open();
         using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Customers SET City = 'New York' WHERE CustomerID = 'ALFKI'", connection))
         {
             int rowsAffected = command.ExecuteNonQuery();
             Console.WriteLine($"Rows affected: {rowsAffected}");
         }
     }
     ```

2. **ExecuteScalar**:
   - Executes a SQL command and returns the first column of the first row of the result set.
   - Useful when you want to retrieve a single value from the database, such as the count of rows or an aggregated result.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
     {
         connection.Open();
         using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers", connection))
         {
             object result = command.ExecuteScalar();
             int rowCount = Convert.ToInt32(result);
             Console.WriteLine($"Total rows: {rowCount}");
         }
     }
     ```

3. **ExecuteReader**:
   - Executes a SQL command and returns a `DataReader` object that allows you to read the result set row by row.
   - Used when you need to retrieve a large number of rows or iterate over the result set.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
     {
         connection.Open();
         using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Customers", connection))
         {
             using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
             {
                 while (reader.Read())
                 {
                     string customerId = reader.GetString(0);
                     string companyName = reader.GetString(1);
                     Console.WriteLine($"Customer ID: {customerId}, Company Name: {companyName}");
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

These Execute methods provide different ways to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from a database based on the specific requirements of your application.

### What are the Authentication techniques used to connect to SQL Server?

When connecting to SQL Server from an application, you can use different authentication techniques based on the security requirements of your application. The commonly used authentication techniques are:

1. **Windows Authentication** (Integrated Security):
   - Uses the Windows user account to authenticate the user.
   - Provides a seamless login experience for users already authenticated with their Windows credentials.
   - Example connection string:
     ```
     Data Source=myServerAddress;Initial Catalog=myDatabase;Integrated Security=True;
     ```

2. **SQL Server Authentication** (Username and Password):
   - Uses a SQL Server login and password to authenticate the user.
   - Requires creating and managing separate login credentials in SQL Server.
   - Example connection string:
     ```
     Data Source=myServerAddress;Initial Catalog=myDatabase;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword;
     ```

3. **Azure Active Directory Authentication**:
   - Allows authentication using Azure Active Directory credentials.
   - Suitable for applications hosted in Azure and utilizing Azure Active Directory for user authentication.
   - Example connection string:
     ```
     Data Source=myServerAddress;Initial Catalog=myDatabase;Authentication=Active Directory Integrated;
     ```

Depending on your application's security requirements and the environment in which it operates, you can choose the appropriate authentication technique to connect to SQL Server.

> It's important to note that connection strings and authentication techniques may vary based on the specific database provider or ORM framework you are using.

### What is object pooling?

Object pooling is a technique used in software development to improve performance and resource utilization by reusing objects instead of creating and destroying them frequently. In the context of database connectivity, object pooling is often used with database connection objects.

In the case of ADO.NET, object pooling allows you to reuse database connections instead of creating a new connection each time you need to interact with the database. Instead of closing the connection and releasing its resources, the connection is returned to a pool where it can be reused by another part of the application.

Object pooling offers the following benefits:

1. **Performance Improvement**: Reusing objects eliminates the overhead of creating and destroying objects, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Reusing objects from a pool can significantly improve application performance.

2. **Resource Management**: By reusing objects, you can effectively manage limited resources, such as database connections. Pooling allows you to efficiently utilize available resources without exhausting them.

3. **Scalability**: Object pooling can improve the scalability of your application by reducing the load on the system. It allows you to handle more concurrent requests without exceeding resource limits.

4. **Connection Efficiency**: In the case of database connections, object pooling helps minimize the overhead associated with establishing and tearing down connections. Reusing connections from a pool can lead to faster database operations.

> It's important to note that object pooling should be used judiciously and in situations where object creation and destruction are costly operations. In some scenarios, like short-lived or stateless operations, object pooling may not provide significant benefits.

.NET provides various mechanisms for implementing object pooling, such as connection pooling in ADO.NET, the `ObjectPool<T>` class in the System.Buffers namespace, and custom pooling implementations.

By leveraging object pooling, you can optimize resource utilization and enhance the performance of your applications, particularly when dealing with expensive objects like database connections.

### What is connection pooling?

Connection pooling is a technique used in database connectivity to manage and reuse database connections. It allows multiple clients or threads to share a pool of pre-established connections to a database, rather than creating a new connection for every database interaction.

Here's how connection pooling works:

1. **Connection Establishment**: When an application requests a database connection, a connection object is created and established with the database server.

2. **Connection Pool Creation**: Instead of immediately closing the connection, the connection is returned to a connection pool managed by the database provider. The connection pool keeps the connection open and available for reuse.

3. **Connection Reuse**: When another request for a database connection is made, instead of creating a new connection, the connection pool checks if there is an available connection in the pool. If a connection is available, it is retrieved from the pool and assigned to the new request.

4. **Connection Release**: After the database interaction is completed, the application releases the connection back to the connection pool. The connection is not closed immediately but remains open in the pool for subsequent reuse.

Connection pooling offers several benefits:

1. **Performance Improvement**: Reusing connections from the pool eliminates the overhead of establishing a new connection for every database operation. It reduces the connection establishment time and improves application performance.

2. **Resource Optimization**: By reusing connections, connection pooling allows you to optimize the utilization of database resources. It ensures that connections are efficiently managed and not wasted.

3. **Scalability**: Connection pooling can enhance the scalability of an application by handling a large number of concurrent database requests without overwhelming the database server.

4. **Connection Efficiency**: With connection pooling, the application can quickly obtain a connection from the pool, reducing the time spent on establishing a new connection. It leads to faster database operations.

> It's important to note that connection pooling is typically handled automatically by the ADO.NET framework in .NET. When using ADO.NET, you don't need to explicitly manage the connection pooling mechanism. The framework manages the connection pool transparently, allowing you to focus on writing database code.

Overall, connection pooling is a valuable technique for optimizing database connectivity and improving the performance and scalability of applications that interact with databases.

### What is the difference between DataReader and DataSet?

DataReader and DataSet are both data access components in ADO.NET, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics. Here are the key differences between DataReader and DataSet:

1. **Purpose:**
- DataReader: DataReader provides a read-only, forward-only stream of data from a database. It is used for retrieving data in a fast and efficient manner, especially when you need to read large result sets.
- DataSet: DataSet is an in-memory representation of data that can hold multiple tables with relationships. It provides a disconnected and cached view of the data retrieved from a database. It is used for storing and manipulating data, including performing complex data operations.

1. **Data Retrieval:**
- DataReader: DataReader retrieves data in a forward-only and read-only manner. It sequentially reads data from the database as you iterate through the result set. It is optimized for retrieving large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.
- DataSet: DataSet retrieves data from a database and stores it in memory as a set of DataTable objects. It can hold multiple tables, along with their relationships and constraints. The data is retrieved all at once and can be accessed and manipulated in a disconnected manner.

1. **Data Access:**
- DataReader: DataReader provides a lightweight and efficient way to access data when you need to read and process it sequentially. It is typically used for scenarios where you don't need to store and manipulate the entire data set.
- DataSet: DataSet provides a rich set of features for data access and manipulation. It allows you to perform various operations such as filtering, sorting, and updating data. It is suitable for scenarios where you need to work with the data in a disconnected manner and perform complex data operations.

1. **Memory Consumption:**
- DataReader: DataReader consumes less memory because it retrieves data in a forward-only manner and doesn't store the entire result set in memory.
- DataSet: DataSet consumes more memory as it stores the entire data set in memory, including multiple tables and related data. It is suitable for scenarios where you need to work with the data offline and perform extensive operations.

1. **Performance:**
- DataReader: DataReader provides better performance for reading large result sets because it retrieves data on-demand and doesn't require buffering the entire result set in memory.
- DataSet: DataSet may have slightly lower performance compared to DataReader when dealing with large result sets because it loads the entire data set into memory.

In summary, DataReader is suitable for scenarios where you need fast and efficient data retrieval, especially for large result sets. DataSet, on the other hand, is more versatile and suitable for scenarios where you need to work with the data in a disconnected and cached manner, performing various data operations.

### What are all components of ADO.NET Data Provider?

ADO.NET is a data access technology in .NET that provides a consistent way to access data from different data sources. The ADO.NET data provider consists of the following main components:

1. **Connection**: The `Connection` object represents a connection to a data source. It provides methods for establishing and managing the connection, such as `Open`, `Close`, and `ExecuteNonQuery`.

2. **Command**: The `Command` object represents a SQL statement or stored procedure that is executed against a data source. It includes properties and methods to set the command text, parameters, and execute the command, such as `ExecuteReader`, `ExecuteNonQuery`, and `ExecuteScalar`.

3. **DataReader**: The `DataReader` object provides a forward-only and read-only stream of data retrieved from a data source. It allows you to efficiently retrieve and process large result sets. It provides methods for reading data sequentially, such as `Read`, `GetString`, and `GetInt32`.

4. **DataSet**: The `DataSet` object is an in-memory representation of data that can hold multiple tables, relationships, and constraints. It provides a disconnected and cached view of the data retrieved from a data source. It includes `DataTable` objects that represent the structure and data of the tables.

5. **DataAdapter**: The `DataAdapter` object acts as a bridge between a `DataSet` and a data source. It provides methods for filling a `DataSet` with data from the data source (`Fill`), updating changes in the `DataSet` back to the data source (`Update`), and managing the connection during the data operations.

6. **Parameter**: The `Parameter` object represents a parameter in a SQL statement or stored procedure. It allows you to specify input, output, and return parameters for command execution. Parameters can be used to pass values to the command and retrieve values from the command.

7. **Transaction**: The `Transaction` object represents a database transaction. It allows you to group multiple database operations into a single atomic unit of work. Transactions ensure that all operations within the transaction are either committed or rolled back together.

These components work together to provide a powerful and flexible data access framework in ADO.NET. They enable developers to connect to databases, execute queries and commands, retrieve and manipulate data, and manage transactions in a consistent and efficient manner.

### Is it possible to load multiple tables in a dataset?

Yes, it is possible to load multiple tables in a DataSet in ADO.NET. The DataSet object provides a collection called Tables, which can hold multiple DataTable objects representing different tables.

To load multiple tables into a `DataSet`, you can use a `DataAdapter` to fill each DataTable separately and then add those DataTables to the DataSet's Tables collection. Here's an example:

```csharp
// Create a DataSet
DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();

// Create a DataAdapter for each table
DataAdapter adapter1 = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Table1", connectionString);
DataAdapter adapter2 = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Table2", connectionString);

// Create DataTables
DataTable table1 = new DataTable("Table1");
DataTable table2 = new DataTable("Table2");

// Fill DataTables using DataAdapters
adapter1.Fill(table1);
adapter2.Fill(table2);

// Add DataTables to DataSet
dataSet.Tables.Add(table1);
dataSet.Tables.Add(table2);
```

In the above example, we create a `DataSet` and two DataAdapters, each corresponding to a different table. We also create separate `DataTable` objects for each table. We then use the `Fill` method of each `DataAdapter` to populate the respective DataTables. Finally, we add those DataTables to the `Tables` collection of the `DataSet`.

By loading multiple tables into a DataSet, you can work with related data from different tables in a disconnected manner and perform operations on the dataset as a whole.

### What are different layers of ADO.NET?

ADO.NET follows a layered architecture to provide a separation of concerns and maintainability in data access. The different layers of ADO.NET are:

1. **Data Source Layer**: This layer represents the actual data source, such as a SQL Server database or an XML file. It provides the necessary connectivity and access to the data.

2. **Data Provider Layer**: This layer contains the data providers specific to different data sources. It includes classes like SqlConnection, `SqlDataAdapter`, `OleDbConnection`, `OdbcDataAdapter`, etc. These data providers implement the common interfaces defined in ADO.NET and provide the necessary functionality to interact with the data source.

3. **Connection Layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the data source. It includes classes like `SqlConnection`, `OleDbConnection`, and `OdbcConnection`. These classes provide methods and properties to connect to the data source, open and close connections, and perform connection-related operations.

4. **Command Layer**: This layer is used to execute commands against the data source. It includes classes like `SqlCommand`, `OleDbCommand`, and `OdbcCommand`. These classes provide methods to execute SQL statements or stored procedures and retrieve results from the data source.

5. **Data Reader Layer**: This layer is used to efficiently read and retrieve data from the data source in a forward-only, read-only manner. It includes classes like `SqlDataReader`, `OleDbDataReader`, and `OdbcDataReader`. Data readers provide a fast, streaming mechanism to access data row by row.

6. **Data Set Layer**: This layer provides a disconnected, in-memory representation of data. It includes classes like `DataSet`, `DataTable`, `DataRow`, and `DataColumn`. DataSets allow you to work with data in a disconnected manner, perform operations like filtering, sorting, and data binding, and synchronize changes back to the data source.

7. **Data Adapter Layer**: This layer acts as a bridge between the DataSet and the data source. It includes classes like `SqlDataAdapter`, `OleDbDataAdapter`, and `OdbcDataAdapter`. Data adapters facilitate filling the DataSet with data from the data source and updating the data source with changes made to the DataSet.

These layers work together to provide a comprehensive data access framework in ADO.NET, allowing developers to interact with different data sources and manipulate data efficiently.

### What are the data providers in ADO.NET?

ADO.NET provides various data providers for different types of data sources. Some of the commonly used data providers in ADO.NET are:

1. **SQL Server Data Provider** (`System.Data.SqlClient`): This data provider is used to connect to Microsoft SQL Server databases. It provides classes like SqlConnection, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataAdapter`, and `SqlDataReader`.

2. **OLE DB Data Provider** (`System.Data.OleDb`): This data provider is used to connect to databases that support OLE DB, such as Microsoft Access, Oracle, and MySQL. It provides classes like `OleDbConnection`, `OleDbCommand`, `OleDbDataAdapter`, and `OleDbDataReader`.

3. **ODBC Data Provider** (`System.Data.Odbc`): This data provider is used to connect to databases that support ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) protocol. It provides classes like `OdbcConnection`, `OdbcCommand`, `OdbcDataAdapter`, and `OdbcDataReader`.

4. **Entity Framework**: Although not a traditional data provider, Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that provides a higher-level abstraction for working with databases. It supports various database providers, including SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and more.

These data providers encapsulate the necessary functionality to connect to, query, and manipulate data in different data sources. Developers can choose the appropriate data provider based on the specific data source they are working with.

### What is the difference between ExecuteScalar and ExecuteNonQuery?

The ExecuteScalar and ExecuteNonQuery methods are both used for executing SQL commands in ADO.NET, but they have different purposes and return different results.

1. **ExecuteScalar**:
   - The ExecuteScalar method is used to retrieve a single value from the database.
   - It is typically used for executing SQL commands that return a single result, such as aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`) or queries with a `SELECT` statement that retrieves a single value.
   - It returns the first column of the first row in the result set as an object.
   - If the result set is empty, it returns null.
   - It is useful when you need to retrieve a single value and don't need a result set.

2. **ExecuteNonQuery**:
   - The ExecuteNonQuery method is used for executing SQL commands that don't return any data, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and DDL (Data Definition Language) statements.
   - It is typically used for modifying data in the database or executing commands that don't have a result set.
   - It returns the number of rows affected by the command.
   - If the command doesn't affect any rows (e.g., an `UPDATE` statement that doesn't update any rows), it returns 0.
   - It is useful when you need to perform data manipulation operations.

In summary, ExecuteScalar is used to retrieve a single value from the database, while ExecuteNonQuery is used for executing commands that modify data or don't return any data. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific requirements of your application.

### Which method is used by command class to execute SQL statements that return single value?

The `ExecuteScalar` method of the `Command` class is used to execute SQL statements that return a single value.

Example usage:

```csharp
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    
    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers", connection);
    
    // Execute the SQL command and retrieve the single value
    object result = command.ExecuteScalar();
    
    // Cast the result to the appropriate data type
    int count = (int)result;
    
    // Do something with the retrieved value
    Console.WriteLine("Total number of customers: " + count);
}
```

In the above example, the `ExecuteScalar` method is used to execute a SQL statement that returns the count of records in the `Customers` table. The method returns the first column of the first row in the result set, which is the count value. This value is then cast to an integer and used in further processing.

## Entity Framework & Entity Framework Core 

### What is ORM? What are the different types of ORM?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that enables developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming languages. ORM frameworks provide an abstraction layer that maps database tables and their relationships to object-oriented entities, allowing developers to work with database data as objects.

There are several types of ORM frameworks available, including:

1. **Full-featured ORM**: These are comprehensive ORM frameworks that provide a wide range of features for database mapping, query generation, and data manipulation. Examples include Entity Framework (EF) for .NET, Hibernate for Java, and Django ORM for Python.

2. **Micro ORM**: These are lightweight ORM frameworks that focus on simplicity and performance. They provide basic ORM capabilities for mapping database tables to objects and executing CRUD operations. Examples include Dapper for .NET and SQLAlchemy Core for Python.

3. **Code-First ORM**: These ORM frameworks allow developers to define the database schema using code, and the ORM framework generates the necessary database tables and relationships automatically. Examples include EF Code First for .NET and Sequelize for Node.js.

4. **Database-First ORM**: These ORM frameworks work with an existing database schema and generate code and object mappings based on the schema. Examples include EF Database First for .NET and Doctrine for PHP.

Each type of ORM has its own strengths and use cases, and the choice of ORM depends on factors such as the complexity of the project, performance requirements, and developer preferences.

### What is Entity Framework?

Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications. It is a component of the Microsoft .NET ecosystem and provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with relational databases.

Entity Framework enables developers to work with databases using object-oriented concepts. It eliminates the need for writing complex SQL queries and manual mapping between database tables and objects. With Entity Framework, developers can define their data model using classes and properties, and the framework takes care of generating the database schema and handling CRUD operations.

Key features of Entity Framework include:

1. **Object-Relational Mapping**: Entity Framework maps database tables to object types, allowing developers to work with database data as objects.

2. **LINQ Integration**: Entity Framework integrates with Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), enabling developers to write type-safe and intuitive queries against the database.

3. **Code-First and Database-First Approaches**: Entity Framework supports both code-first and database-first development approaches. In code-first, developers define the data model using classes and properties, and Entity Framework generates the database schema. In database-first, developers start with an existing database schema and generate code and object mappings.

4. **Change Tracking and Lazy Loading**: Entity Framework automatically tracks changes made to objects and can lazily load related entities from the database.

5. **Migrations**: Entity Framework supports database schema migrations, allowing developers to evolve the database schema over time without losing data.

Entity Framework is widely used in .NET applications for data access and persistence. It provides a powerful and developer-friendly way to interact with relational databases, simplifying the development process and reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

### How will you differentiate ADO.NET from Entity Framework?

ADO.NET and Entity Framework are both data access technologies in the .NET ecosystem, but they differ in their approach and functionality.

**ADO.NET**:
- ADO.NET is a low-level data access technology in .NET.
- It provides a set of classes and APIs for interacting with databases.
- Developers need to write explicit code to establish database connections, create and execute SQL queries, handle data readers, and manage transactions.
- ADO.NET requires manual mapping between database tables and objects, often using techniques like DataReaders or DataSets.
- It offers more control and flexibility but requires more manual coding and is more suited for scenarios where fine-grained control over data access is needed.

**Entity Framework**:
- Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework built on top of ADO.NET.
- It provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with databases, focusing on object-oriented concepts and eliminating the need for writing low-level data access code.
- Developers work with entities (classes) and properties, and Entity Framework handles the translation of these objects to and from the database.
- Entity Framework supports various development approaches, such as code-first and database-first, which simplify the mapping between database schema and objects.
- It offers features like change tracking, lazy loading, and LINQ integration, which simplify common data access tasks.
- Entity Framework generates SQL queries behind the scenes and handles database connections, transactions, and other low-level details automatically.

In summary, ADO.NET is a lower-level data access technology that requires more manual coding and offers fine-grained control, while Entity Framework is a higher-level ORM framework that abstracts away much of the low-level data access code and provides more productivity and convenience for developers.

### How Entity Framework works? OR How to setup EF?

Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies data access by providing an abstraction layer between the application and the database. Here is an overview of how Entity Framework works and how to set it up:

1. Define Entity Classes:
   - Create entity classes that represent database tables or views.
   - Each entity class typically corresponds to a table or view in the database.
   - Use attributes or fluent API to define relationships, constraints, and mappings between entities.

2. Create DbContext Class:
   - Create a class that derives from the `DbContext` class.
   - This class acts as a bridge between the application and the database, providing access to the entities and handling database operations.

3. Configure Connection String:
   - Set up a connection string in the application's configuration file (`appsettings.json` in ASP.NET Core) to specify the database connection details.

4. Install Entity Framework Packages:
   - Install the required Entity Framework packages using NuGet package manager.
   - The packages typically include the core EF package and database provider-specific packages (e.g., Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer for SQL Server).

5. Configure DbContext:
   - In the `DbContext` class, override the `OnConfiguring` method to configure the database provider and connection string.
   - Alternatively, you can configure the DbContext using dependency injection and the `ConfigureServices` method in ASP.NET Core.

6. Migrations (Optional):
   - If using the Code First approach, you can enable EF Migrations to manage database schema changes.
   - Migrations allow you to create, update, and revert database schema changes using CLI commands or package manager console.

7. Perform Database Operations:
   - Use the DbContext instance to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the entities.
   - Entity Framework automatically translates your LINQ queries into SQL queries and handles the database operations.

By following these steps, you can set up and use Entity Framework in your application for simplified data access and management.

### What is meant by DBContext and DBSet?

In Entity Framework, `DbContext` and `DbSet` are important classes that facilitate database access and entity management:

1. DbContext:
   - The `DbContext` class is the main class in Entity Framework that represents a session with the database.
   - It is responsible for coordinating the database operations, managing entities, and tracking changes.
   - It provides a high-level API for interacting with the database, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting entities.

2. DbSet:
   - The `DbSet` class is a property of the `DbContext` class that represents a collection of entities of a specific type.
   - Each entity class in your application is typically mapped to a corresponding `DbSet` property in the `DbContext`.
   - The `DbSet` provides a set of methods and properties for querying, adding, updating, and deleting entities in the associated table.

By using the `DbContext` and `DbSet` classes, you can easily interact with the database, perform CRUD operations, and manage entities in your Entity Framework application.

### What is the difference between LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework?

LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework are both ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) provided by Microsoft for data access in .NET applications. Here are the key differences between the two:

1. **Purpose**:
   - LINQ to SQL was designed primarily for working with SQL Server databases and has limited support for other database providers.
   - Entity Framework is a more robust and feature-rich ORM that supports multiple database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

2. **Mapping Approach**:
   - LINQ to SQL uses a simple one-to-one mapping approach, where each table in the database is mapped to a corresponding class in the application.
   - Entity Framework supports more advanced mapping options, including table splitting, complex type mapping, inheritance mapping, and many-to-many relationships.

3. **Querying**:
   - LINQ to SQL provides a simplified query syntax called LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to query and manipulate data.
   - Entity Framework also supports LINQ, but it offers more advanced querying capabilities, including support for complex queries, eager loading, lazy loading, and explicit loading.

4. **Development Lifecycle**:
   - LINQ to SQL is considered a lightweight ORM and provides a simpler development experience with less overhead.
   - Entity Framework is a more feature-rich and complex ORM, offering more flexibility and advanced features but with a slightly steeper learning curve.

In summary, while LINQ to SQL is a simpler and more lightweight ORM with limited database provider support, Entity Framework is a more powerful and versatile ORM with broader database provider compatibility and advanced mapping and querying capabilities.

### What is Entity Framework Core and how does it differ from previous versions of Entity Framework?

EF Core (Entity Framework Core) is an open-source, lightweight, and cross-platform Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework provided by Microsoft. It is designed to simplify the development of data access layers in .NET applications.

Key differences between EF Core and previous versions of Entity Framework include:

1. **Cross-platform support**: EF Core is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be used in various .NET implementations, such as .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin.

2. **Improved performance**: EF Core has been optimized for performance compared to previous versions. It provides faster startup time, better query performance, and reduced memory footprint.

3. **Modular architecture**: EF Core follows a modular design, allowing developers to include only the necessary components for their applications. This results in a smaller footprint and better performance.

4. **Support for non-relational databases**: EF Core includes support for NoSQL databases and other non-relational data stores, in addition to traditional relational databases.

5. **Enhanced extensibility**: EF Core provides more flexibility for customization and extension. It allows developers to define their own conventions, configure entity mapping through data annotations or fluent API, and implement custom behavior through interceptors and providers.

Overall, EF Core is a modern and lightweight ORM framework that offers improved performance, cross-platform compatibility, and increased flexibility compared to previous versions of Entity Framework.

### What are the advantages of using Entity Framework Core over raw ADO.NET or other ORMs?

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) offers several advantages over raw ADO.NET or other ORMs:

1. **Simplified data access**: EF Core abstracts away the complexities of data access, allowing developers to work with a higher-level, object-oriented API instead of writing low-level SQL queries. This simplifies development and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed.

2. **Rapid development**: EF Core provides a code-first approach, where developers can define their data models using classes and attributes, and EF Core takes care of generating the database schema. This accelerates the development process by eliminating the need to manually write SQL scripts or manage database schema changes.

3. **Cross-platform support**: EF Core is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is compatible with various .NET implementations, such as .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin. This allows developers to build applications that can run on different operating systems and frameworks.

4. **Automatic change tracking**: EF Core automatically tracks changes made to entities and generates appropriate SQL statements to persist those changes to the database. This eliminates the need for manual tracking and handling of entity state, making it easier to work with data in an object-oriented manner.

5. **Query flexibility**: EF Core provides a powerful querying API called LINQ (Language Integrated Query) that allows developers to express complex queries using familiar C# syntax. LINQ queries are type-safe, composable, and can be easily optimized by EF Core to improve query performance.

6. **Database provider support**: EF Core supports a wide range of database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. This allows developers to work with their preferred database system without needing to learn different querying techniques or APIs.

7. **Migration support**: EF Core includes built-in migration capabilities, allowing developers to easily manage database schema changes over time. It provides commands to create, apply, and revert migrations, making it simple to keep the database schema in sync with the application's data models.

### Explain the different approaches for working with Entity Framework Core: Database-First, Model-First, and Code-First.

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) supports three different approaches for working with data models and databases: Database-First, Model-First, and Code-First.

1. **Database-First Approach**:
   - In the Database-First approach, the database schema is already defined, and EF Core generates the corresponding entity classes based on the existing database.
   - Developers start by connecting EF Core to an existing database using tools like the Scaffold-DbContext command or the EF Core Power Tools extension.
   - EF Core reads the database schema and generates entity classes, along with the DbContext, that represent the tables and relationships in the database.
   - Developers can then use these generated entity classes to query, insert, update, and delete data in the database.

2. **Model-First Approach**:
   - In the Model-First approach, developers create the data model using a visual designer or XML-based modeling tools.
   - They define the entities, their properties, and the relationships between them using a visual interface or XML markup.
   - EF Core then generates the database schema based on the defined model.
   - Developers can use the generated DbContext and entity classes to perform CRUD operations on the database.

3. **Code-First Approach**:
   - The Code-First approach is the most popular and flexible approach in EF Core.
   - Developers write the entity classes and their relationships in code, typically using C# or VB.NET.
   - EF Core then uses these classes to create the corresponding database schema automatically.
   - Developers can use data annotations, fluent API, or a combination of both to define additional configurations and constraints.
   - Code-First approach allows for better control over the database schema and provides options for data seeding, migrations, and database updates.

Each approach has its own benefits and is suitable for different scenarios. Database-First is useful when working with an existing database, Model-First is suitable for visual designers or when the focus is on the data model, and Code-First provides flexibility and control over the data model and database schema.

### What are migrations in Entity Framework Core and how are they used for database schema management?

Migrations in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) provide a way to manage database schema changes over time. Migrations allow developers to make incremental updates to the database schema without losing existing data.

Here's how migrations work in EF Core:

1. **Enabling Migrations**:
   - Developers start by enabling migrations in their EF Core project using the `Add-Migration` command in the Package Manager Console or the `dotnet ef migrations add` command in the terminal.
   - This command creates a `Migrations` folder in the project, which contains migration files.

2. **Creating Migrations**:
   - Developers create a new migration by specifying a unique name for the migration.
   - EF Core examines the current state of the data model and generates a migration file that contains the necessary operations to apply the desired schema changes.
   - The migration file includes both the `Up` method (to apply the changes) and the `Down` method (to revert the changes if needed).

3. **Applying Migrations**:
   - Developers apply the migrations to the database using the `Update-Database` command in the Package Manager Console or the `dotnet ef database update` command in the terminal.
   - EF Core applies the pending migrations to the target database, executing the necessary SQL statements to create or modify database objects.

4. **Rolling Back Migrations**:
   - If needed, developers can roll back a migration using the `Remove-Migration` command in the Package Manager Console or the `dotnet ef migrations remove` command in the terminal.
   - This reverts the last applied migration, effectively undoing the corresponding schema changes in the database.

Migrations provide a structured and repeatable way to manage database schema changes. They allow developers to work collaboratively, apply version control, and easily deploy database updates across different environments.

### How do you configure relationships between entities in Entity Framework Core using data annotations or Fluent API?

In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), relationships between entities can be configured using either data annotations or the Fluent API. Both approaches provide flexibility in defining how entities relate to each other in the database schema.

**Using Data Annotations:**
Data annotations are attributes applied to entity classes or properties to define relationships.

- One-to-One Relationship:
  - To configure a one-to-one relationship, you can use the `[ForeignKey]` attribute and the navigation properties.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    [ForeignKey("PropertyName")]
    public virtual RelatedEntity RelatedEntity { get; set; }
    ```

- One-to-Many Relationship:
  - To configure a one-to-many relationship, you can use the `[ForeignKey]` attribute and the navigation properties.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    [ForeignKey("PropertyName")]
    public virtual ICollection<RelatedEntity> RelatedEntities { get; set; }
    ```

- Many-to-Many Relationship:
  - To configure a many-to-many relationship, you can use the `[ForeignKey]` attribute and create a join entity representing the relationship.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    [ForeignKey("PropertyName1")]
    public virtual ICollection<JoinEntity> JoinEntities1 { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey("PropertyName2")]
    public virtual ICollection<JoinEntity> JoinEntities2 { get; set; }
    ```

**Using Fluent API:**
The Fluent API allows for more advanced configuration options and is used by method chaining in the `OnModelCreating` method of the `DbContext` class.

- One-to-One Relationship:
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    builder.Entity<Entity1>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity2)
        .WithOne()
        .HasForeignKey<Entity2>(e => e.Entity1Id);
    ```

- One-to-Many Relationship:
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    builder.Entity<Entity1>()
        .HasMany(e => e.Entity2s)
        .WithOne(e => e.Entity1)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity1Id);
    ```

- Many-to-Many Relationship:
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    builder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasKey(e => new { e.Entity1Id, e.Entity2Id });

    builder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity1)
        .WithMany(e => e.JoinEntities1)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity1Id);

    builder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity2)
        .WithMany(e => e.JoinEntities2)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity2Id);
    ```

The Fluent API provides more control and flexibility in configuring relationships, especially for complex scenarios and scenarios that cannot be represented by data annotations alone.

```csharp
// Example of Fluent API configuration in DbContext's OnModelCreating method
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Entity1>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity2)
        .WithOne()
        .HasForeignKey<Entity2>(e => e.Entity1Id);

    modelBuilder.Entity<Entity1>()
        .HasMany(e => e.Entity2s)
        .WithOne(e => e.Entity1)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity1Id);

    modelBuilder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasKey(e => new { e.Entity1Id, e.Entity2Id });

    modelBuilder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity1)
        .WithMany(e => e.JoinEntities1)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity1Id);

    modelBuilder.Entity<JoinEntity>()
        .HasOne(e => e.Entity2)
        .WithMany(e => e.JoinEntities2)
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.Entity2Id);
}
```

## Dapper

### What is Dapper and why would you choose to use it?

Dapper is a micro-ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for .NET that provides a lightweight and efficient way to map database queries to objects. It offers high performance, easy-to-use APIs, and great flexibility. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use Dapper:

1. **Performance**: Dapper is known for its high performance due to its lightweight implementation and direct mapping of query results to objects.

2. **Simplicity**: Dapper has a small learning curve and doesn't require complex configuration. You can write raw SQL queries and map the results to objects using Dapper's query methods.

3. **Control**: Dapper provides more control over database operations. You can write custom SQL queries and optimize them as needed. It also supports stored procedures and transaction management.

4. **Compatibility**: Dapper works with various database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous patterns.

5. **Integration**: Dapper can be easily integrated into existing codebases and used alongside other ORMs or frameworks like Entity Framework.

Dapper is a popular choice for developers who value performance, control, and simplicity in their data access layer.

### Explain the difference between Dapper and other ORMs like Entity Framework.

Dapper and Entity Framework are both popular ORM libraries in the .NET ecosystem, but they have some key differences. Here's an overview of the differences between Dapper and Entity Framework:

1. **Performance**: Dapper is known for its superior performance compared to Entity Framework. Dapper focuses on simplicity and lightweight implementation, which results in faster execution times and lower memory overhead.

2. **Mapping**: Dapper uses a simple and direct mapping approach where you write your own SQL queries and map the results to objects manually. Entity Framework, on the other hand, provides automatic mapping between database tables and objects using conventions or explicit configuration.

3. **Control**: Dapper gives you more control over the SQL queries and allows you to optimize them for performance. With Entity Framework, you rely on its query generation capabilities, which may not always produce the most efficient SQL statements.

4. **Complexity**: Dapper is simpler and has a smaller learning curve compared to Entity Framework. It doesn't provide advanced features like change tracking, complex query building, or automatic schema migrations. This simplicity can be an advantage for small to medium-sized projects or scenarios where you prefer more manual control.

5. **Database Support**: Entity Framework has broad database provider support and works with different database systems, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. Dapper also supports multiple database providers, but it requires more manual handling of provider-specific features.

In summary, Dapper is a lightweight and performant ORM that provides more control and simplicity, making it a good choice for scenarios where raw performance and manual SQL control are critical. Entity Framework offers a higher level of abstraction, automatic mapping, and advanced features, making it suitable for complex applications that prioritize productivity and rapid development.

### How do you execute a query using Dapper?

To execute a query using Dapper, you can follow these steps:

1. **Establish a database connection**: Create a connection to your database using the appropriate database provider, such as SqlConnection for SQL Server.

2. **Write the SQL query**: Compose your SQL query as a string.

3. **Execute the query**: Use the Dapper extension methods to execute the query and retrieve the results. Dapper provides methods like Query, QueryFirstOrDefault, QuerySingleOrDefault, etc., to execute different types of queries.

4. **Map the results**: Dapper allows you to map the query results to objects using either manual mapping or automatic mapping based on property names. You can use the Query method with a type parameter to map the results to objects directly.

Here's an example of executing a query using Dapper:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = @Country";
    var customers = connection.Query<Customer>(sql, new { Country = "USA" });
    
    // Process the results
    foreach (var customer in customers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Customer: {customer.FirstName} {customer.LastName}");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we establish a connection to the database, write a SQL query to select customers from a specific country, execute the query using the Query method, and map the results to a list of Customer objects.

Remember to dispose of the connection object when you're done to release the database resources.

### How do you map query results to objects using Dapper?

To map query results to objects using Dapper, you have two options: manual mapping and automatic mapping based on property names.

1. **Manual Mapping**: With manual mapping, you explicitly define the mapping between the query results and your object properties. You can use the `Query` method with an anonymous type or dynamic as the result type and then manually map the properties to your desired object.

    ```csharp
    var result = connection.Query("SELECT Id, Name FROM Products");
    var products = result.Select(r => new Product
    {
        Id = r.Id,
        Name = r.Name
    }).ToList();
    ```

    In the example above, the query returns a result set with columns `Id` and `Name`. We use the `Query` method to execute the query and obtain the result. Then, we manually map the properties from the query result to the `Product` object.

2. **Automatic Mapping**: Dapper also supports automatic mapping based on property names. You can use the `Query` method with a type parameter, and Dapper will automatically map the query results to the properties of the specified type.

    ```csharp
    var products = connection.Query<Product>("SELECT Id, Name FROM Products").ToList();
    ```

    In this case, Dapper matches the column names in the query results (`Id` and `Name`) with the property names in the `Product` class and automatically maps the values.

Note that the property names in your object should match the column names in the query results for automatic mapping to work correctly.

Choose the mapping approach that best fits your scenario based on the complexity of the query and the desired level of control over the mapping process.

### What are the advantages of using Dapper over raw ADO.NET?

Dapper offers several advantages over raw ADO.NET when it comes to working with data access in .NET applications:

1. **Performance**: Dapper is known for its exceptional performance. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it faster than traditional ORMs like Entity Framework. Dapper achieves this by using lightweight object mapping and avoiding unnecessary abstractions.

2. **Simplicity**: Dapper is easy to use and has a simple API. It leverages SQL queries directly, allowing you to write and execute SQL statements easily. There is no need to learn a complex query language or deal with complex configuration settings. Dapper focuses on providing a straightforward and intuitive experience.

3. **Control**: Dapper gives you more control over the SQL queries and result mapping. You have the flexibility to write custom SQL queries tailored to your specific needs. Dapper allows you to map query results to objects using manual or automatic mapping, providing you with the control to fine-tune the data access process.

4. **Compatibility**: Dapper is compatible with a wide range of database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and more. This makes it a versatile choice for applications that need to work with different database systems.

5. **Integration**: Dapper seamlessly integrates with existing ADO.NET infrastructure and can be used alongside other data access technologies. You can combine Dapper with raw ADO.NET or use it within an existing ADO.NET-based application without any conflicts.

6. **Lightweight**: Dapper is a lightweight library with minimal dependencies. It has a small footprint and does not add significant overhead to your application. This makes it suitable for projects where resource consumption and deployment size are important factors.

Overall, Dapper is a powerful and efficient micro-ORM that offers performance, simplicity, control, compatibility, and integration advantages over raw ADO.NET. It is particularly well-suited for scenarios where raw SQL control and high-performance data access are critical requirements.

### How does Dapper handle parameterized queries?

Dapper provides support for parameterized queries, which is an important aspect of secure and efficient data access. Parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection attacks and improve query performance.

To use parameterized queries with Dapper, you can pass an anonymous object or a custom class as a parameter to the query method. Dapper will automatically map the properties of the object to the corresponding parameters in the SQL query.

Here's an example of using parameterized queries with Dapper:

```csharp
var customerId = 1;
var query = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId";

var customer = connection.QuerySingleOrDefault<Customer>(query, new { CustomerId = customerId });
```

In the above example, the `@CustomerId` parameter is defined in the SQL query, and the `new { CustomerId = customerId }` object is used to pass the parameter value. Dapper maps the `CustomerId` property from the object to the `@CustomerId` parameter in the query.

By using parameterized queries, Dapper ensures that the query values are properly sanitized and escaped, protecting against SQL injection attacks. It also helps in query optimization by allowing the database engine to cache and reuse query execution plans.

Parameterized queries are an essential feature for secure and efficient data access, and Dapper makes it easy to work with them by automatically mapping parameters from objects.

### Can you use Dapper with stored procedures? If yes, how?

Yes, you can use Dapper with stored procedures. Dapper provides convenient methods to execute stored procedures and map the results to objects.

To use Dapper with a stored procedure, you can pass the stored procedure name as a string parameter to the query method, along with the necessary parameters for the stored procedure.

Here's an example of using Dapper with a stored procedure:

```csharp
var parameters = new { CategoryId = 1 };
var products = connection.Query<Product>("GetProductsByCategory", parameters, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);
```

In the above example, the `GetProductsByCategory` is the name of the stored procedure. The `parameters` object is used to pass any input parameters required by the stored procedure. The `commandType` parameter is set to `CommandType.StoredProcedure` to indicate that a stored procedure is being executed.

Dapper will execute the stored procedure and map the results to the specified object type (`Product` in this case). The result will be a collection of `Product` objects representing the output of the stored procedure.

By using Dapper with stored procedures, you can leverage the power and flexibility of stored procedures for complex data operations while still benefiting from the simplicity and performance of Dapper for result mapping.

### Explain the concept of Dynamic Parameters in Dapper.

Dynamic Parameters in Dapper allow you to pass parameters to SQL queries without explicitly defining each parameter by name. It provides a more flexible way to handle parameterized queries, especially when the number of parameters or their values are determined at runtime.

Instead of using anonymous types or named parameters, you can use `DynamicParameters` class provided by Dapper to create dynamic parameters. This class allows you to add parameters dynamically and set their names and values.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of Dynamic Parameters in Dapper:

```csharp
var parameters = new DynamicParameters();
parameters.Add("FirstName", "John");
parameters.Add("LastName", "Doe");
parameters.Add("Age", 25);

var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE FirstName = @FirstName AND LastName = @LastName AND Age = @Age";
var users = connection.Query<User>(query, parameters);
```

In the above example, the `DynamicParameters` object is created and parameters are added using the `Add` method. The parameter names (`FirstName`, `LastName`, `Age`) are specified as strings, and their corresponding values are provided.

When executing the query, you can pass the `DynamicParameters` object as the parameter value, and Dapper will automatically map the parameters to the query using their names.

Dynamic Parameters are particularly useful when you need to handle scenarios where the number of parameters or their values vary dynamically, such as constructing dynamic SQL queries or building filters with optional parameters.

Using Dynamic Parameters in Dapper provides flexibility and simplifies the parameterization process, making it easier to work with dynamic queries and varying input conditions.

### How does Dapper handle database transactions?

Dapper provides support for handling database transactions by utilizing the `DbConnection` object's `BeginTransaction` method. Here's how Dapper handles database transactions:

1. Begin a transaction: You can begin a database transaction by calling the `BeginTransaction` method on your `DbConnection` object. This method returns a `DbTransaction` object representing the transaction.

2. Execute queries within the transaction: To execute queries within the transaction, you pass the `DbTransaction` object as an additional parameter to Dapper's query methods, such as `Query`, `Execute`, etc. Dapper will automatically associate the query execution with the ongoing transaction.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use Dapper with a database transaction:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
    {
        try
        {
            // Execute queries within the transaction
            var query1 = "INSERT INTO Customers (Name) VALUES (@Name)";
            connection.Execute(query1, new { Name = "John Doe" }, transaction);

            var query2 = "UPDATE Orders SET Status = @Status WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId";
            connection.Execute(query2, new { Status = "Completed", CustomerId = 1 }, transaction);

            // Commit the transaction
            transaction.Commit();
        }
        catch
        {
            // Handle any exception and rollback the transaction if necessary
            transaction.Rollback();
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, a `SqlConnection` object is created and opened. Then, a transaction is started using the `BeginTransaction` method. The subsequent queries are executed using Dapper's `Execute` method, passing the `DbTransaction` object as a parameter. Finally, if an exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back; otherwise, it is committed.

By utilizing database transactions with Dapper, you can ensure that a group of database operations is treated as an atomic unit, allowing you to maintain data integrity and consistency.

### Can you explain the concept of Query Multiple in Dapper and when would you use it?

The concept of "Query Multiple" in Dapper refers to the ability to retrieve multiple result sets from a single database query. This feature can be useful when you have a query that returns multiple result sets, such as when using stored procedures that produce multiple result sets or when executing complex queries involving multiple SELECT statements.

With Dapper's "Query Multiple" feature, you can execute a query that returns multiple result sets and then map each result set to a separate object or type. This allows you to efficiently retrieve and process multiple sets of data in a single database round-trip.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the "Query Multiple" feature in Dapper:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    using (var multi = connection.QueryMultiple("YourQuery", commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure))
    {
        var result1 = multi.Read<SomeType1>().ToList();
        var result2 = multi.Read<SomeType2>().ToList();
        var result3 = multi.Read<SomeType3>().ToList();

        // Process the result sets as needed
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `QueryMultiple` method is used to execute a query (in this case, a stored procedure) that returns multiple result sets. The `Read` method is then called for each result set, specifying the desired type (`SomeType1`, `SomeType2`, etc.), and the results are mapped to the corresponding objects.

By using "Query Multiple" in Dapper, you can reduce the number of database round-trips and improve performance when dealing with scenarios involving multiple result sets.
